Advanced Installation
*********************

Python 2 or 3
=============

Brightway2 is written for python >= 3.4, but runs on python 2.7 as well. Tests are run against 2.7, 3.4 and 3.5. Python 3 versions less than 3.4 are not supported.

The library `eight <https://github.com/kislyuk/eight>`__ is used to forward-port python 2.7 code to 3.4. This means that ``super``, ``str``, and ``bytes`` have 3.4 semantics. The print function and true division are imported from ``__future__``, as are ``unicode_literals``.

Creating the Brightway2 installation package
============================================

After installing all packages, clean conda:

    conda clean -p -t -i -y

.. _anaconda:

Building from source: Continuum Miniconda
=========================================

The easiest way to get started is to download

1. Save `Miniconda 3.4 (64-bit version) <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`__ for your OS

On Mac OS X, you might have to make the bash shell executable:

.. code-block:: bash

    chmod +x ~/Downloads/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-x86_64.sh

(or whatever version you have; you should probably adjust the path as well)

2. Run the Miniconda installer. Make it your default python.

3. In a terminal window or command prompt, make sure ``conda`` is up to date:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install conda && conda update conda

4. Create a python environ for brightway2:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -n bw2 python=3.4

5. Activate your environment:

.. code-block:: bash

    activate bw2

You will have to activate your brightway2 environment in each new terminal window or command prompt.

6. Install or update some dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install wheel && conda update pip wheel setuptools && conda install numpy ipython ipython-notebook jupyter matplotlib scipy flask lxml requests nose docopt whoosh xlsxwriter xlrd unidecode

6a. If you are on Windows, you also need to do:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install pywin32

7. The package ``eight`` needs to be separately installed, to make sure it gets the exact right dependency packages installed:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --no-cache-dir eight

7a. If you are on Linux (or really anything other than OS X or Windows), you will need a C compiler to build the backage `bw2speedups <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bw2speedups/2.0>`__. This should be provided by your distribution in something like ``build-essentials`` or ``build-essential``.

8. Finally, install the development version of brightway2:

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install --no-cache-dir --pre brightway2

You can now use brightway2 from the python shell or in an ipython notebook.

Activity-browser
================

.. image:: images/activity-browser.png
    :align: center

The activity browser is an **experimental** graphical user interface for Brightway2.

To install:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install networkx seaborn matplotlib
    pip install https://bitbucket.org/cmutel/activity-browser/get/2.0.zip

You can now run the activity browser with the command:

.. code-block:: bash

    activity-browser

.. _windows-install:

Alternatives
============

Windows
-------

Although Brightway2 is relatively simple, installation of the numerical and scientific libraries can be difficult as there is no default compilers installed on most Windows machines. This issue is well-known in the Python community (see `Pycon keynote <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1a4Jbjc-vU>`_, recent `reddit discussion <http://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/2bbd5t/stop_struggling_with_python_on_windows/>`_). The only sensible way is to use a precompiled set of packages.

In addition to ``conda``, the following also work well, but no specific instructions are provided:

.. _canopy:

Enthought Canopy
````````````````

.. warning:: `Canopy Express <https://www.enthought.com/canopy-express/>`_ will not work with Brightway2, as it does `not include the lxml package <https://enthought.com/products/canopy/package-index/>`_.

`Enthought Canopy <https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/>`_ provides a nice Python environment and free academic licenses.


Python(x,y)
```````````

Download and install the `Python(x,y) executable <https://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/wiki/Downloads>`_. All the necessary background libraries will be installed.

Winpython
`````````

`Winpython <http://winpython.sourceforge.net/>`_ is another set of Windows Python packages, similar to Python(x,y). I haven't tried this, but have heard good things. I think you will have to use either ``easy_install`` or `Christoph Gohlke's Windows binaries <http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/>`_ to install lxml.

.. _os-x-install:

Max OS X
--------

On OS X, there are almost too many choices that work well. The simplest way is to use :ref:`canopy` or :ref:`anaconda` - the instructions are the same as on Windows. Alternatively, there are two main OS X-specific alternatives for installing Python packages: `Macports <http://www.macports.org/>`_ and `Homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_. Brightway2 is developed primarily on OS X using Macports, but as it depends on a few standard libraries, either alternative should work well. Homebrew users will have to adapt the following instructions, but reports are that this is relatively simple.

.. note:: See also the :ref:`developer-os-x` notes for an even more powerful & complicated approach, good for software developers.

Follow the `instructions <http://www.macports.org/install.php>`_ and install Macports. Note that both Macports and Homebrew require Xcode to be installed first. Xcode can be installed from the OS X installation disk (for 10.6 or lower), the app store (10.7 or higher), or `other unofficial sources <https://github.com/kennethreitz/osx-gcc-installer>`_.

Next, install the needed Python libraries using this command in the Terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port install python_select py34-scipy py34-numpy py34-pip py34-libxml2 py34-nose py34-sphinx py34-requests py34-flask

Point to the correct Python executable:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port select --set python python34

Next, install the Brightway2 source code using another Terminal command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip-3.4 install --user brightway2

Unfortunately, the Brightway2 scripts aren't in our ``PATH`` environment variable yet. Fix this by adding the following line to the end of the ``.profile`` file in your home directory, and then start a new terminal window:

.. code-block:: bash

    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin

.. _linux-install:

Linux
-----

General instructions are provided for Ubuntu 14.04; people using other distributions are assumed smart to be enough to adapt as necessary. See also :ref:`platform-agnostic` instructions above.

First, install the required ``apt`` packages. You can select them in the graphical interface, or through one command in the terminal:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-scipy python-numpy python-nose python-pip python-lxml cython python-virtualenv virtualenvwrapper build-essential libsuitesparse-dev swig

Next, logout and login again, and create a new virtualenv:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkvirtualenv bw2
    toggleglobalsitepackages


Next, install Brightway2 using another terminal command:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U pip wheel setuptools
    pip install eight bw2speedups scikit-umfpack
    pip install --user brightway2

You may get an error with scikit-umfpack, due to an incompatible UMFPACK. In this case, you will need to download the `source package <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikit-umfpack>`__, and then edit the file ``scikits/umfpack/setup.py`` and comment out or delete line 17:

.. code-block:: python

    umf_info['libraries'].insert(0, 'rt')

.. _platform-agnostic:

Platform-agnostic
-----------------

Installation of Brightway2 has two steps. First, install the following scientific and numeric libraries:

* scipy >= 0.10
* numpy >= 1.6
* lxml
* pip

.. warning:: Make sure that ``SciPy`` builds with support for `UMFPACK <http://www.cise.ufl.edu/research/sparse/umfpack/>`_; you may need to also install `scikits-umpack <https://github.com/rc/scikit-umfpack>`_.

Second, install the Brightway2 package:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install --user brightay2

.. _requirements:

Requirements
````````````

If you want to install packages manually, or not install everything, Brightway2 uses the following Python packages:

* appdirs
* asteval
* docopt
* eight
* flask
* future
* lxml
* numpy
* peewee
* pyprind
* requests
* scipy
* stats_arrays
* unicodecsv
* voluptuous
* whoosh
* xlrd
* xlsxwriter

Developers
==========

.. warning:: If you are developing, it is *strongly* recommended to use `virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/>`__ and `virtualenvwrapper <http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/>`_ (or `virtualenv-win <https://github.com/davidmarble/virtualenvwrapper-win>`_ for Windows users).

If you want to develop with Brightway, then you should also install the following:

* nose
* sphinx

You can install editable Brightway2 packages using `mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e hg+https://bitbucket.org/cmutel/brightway2-data#egg=bw2data
    pip install -e hg+https://bitbucket.org/cmutel/brightway2-calc#egg=bw2calc
    pip install -e hg+https://bitbucket.org/cmutel/brightway2-ui#egg=bw2ui
    pip install -e hg+https://bitbucket.org/cmutel/brightway2-analyzer#egg=bw2analyzer

You can also simply clone the bitbucket source code repositories instead of installing them.

.. _developer-os-x:

Quickstart for OS X developers
------------------------------

Set up python:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port selfupdate
    sudo port install py27-scipy py27-numpy py27-pip py27-libxml2 py27-nose py27-sphinx py27-requests py27-flask py27-virtualenvwrapper mercurial +bash_completion
    sudo port select --set python python27
    sudo port select --set pip pip27
    sudo port select --set virtualenv virtualenv27

Change the shell to macports ``bash``. First, add the macports bash shell as a possibility:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo -s
    # Type in your password here
    echo /opt/local/bin/bash >> /etc/shells
    exit

Then set your default shell

.. code-block:: bash

    chsh -s /opt/local/bin/bash

Add the following lines to the file ``.profile`` in your home directory using your favorite text editor:

.. code-block:: bash

    source /opt/local/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.4/bin/virtualenvwrapper.sh

    if [ -f /opt/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh ]; then
      . /opt/local/etc/profile.d/bash_completion.sh
    fi

You must then start a *new* terminal window, so the updated ``.profile`` is applied.

Create a `virtualenv <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv>`__ and install Brightway2:

.. code-block:: bash

    mkvirtualenv bw2
    toggleglobalsitepackages
    pip install brightway2

Because this is using a virtualenv, you will need to activate the virtualenv each time you start a new terminal with:

.. code-block:: bash

    workon bw2

.. _upgrading:

Upgrading Brightway2
====================

Brightway2 is being actively developed, and new releases come frequently.

.. note:: Please subscribe to the `brightway2 updates mailing list <https://tinyletter.com/brightway2-updates>`_ to be informed of new releases.

To upgrade Brightway2, do the following:

First, make sure your background packages are up to date.

* In Enthought Canopy, this is done through the graphical package manager.
* In anaconda/miniconda, use the following commands (once you have activated your Brightway2 environment):

.. code-block:: bash

    conda update conda
    conda update anaconda

* In macports, use the following commands:

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo port selfupdate
    sudo port upgrade outdated

Next, run the following command. Make sure you are in the correct environment/virtualenv, if you use environments:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -U --no-deps brightway2 bw2data bw2calc bw2analyzer bw2ui bw2io bw2parameters

On rare occasion, the underlying data formats will change. To see if your data needs to be updated, run the following, and follow the instructions if a change is needed:

.. code-block:: bash

    bw2-uptodate

.. _packages:

Brightway2 Packages
===================

Brightway2 is split into several packages, where each package fulfills a certain role in the framework. The idea is that you can be an expert on a certain package, but not have to learn anything about other packages.
