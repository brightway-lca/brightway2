    "First, `dtype_fields` is no longer empty. Instead, there are two fields, `flow` and `index`. Flow in this case means biosphere flows. Because of the way structured arrays work, this needs to be a integer, so we can't insert something like `(\"biosphere\", \"CO2\")`. Instead, we keep a global mapping of biosphere and technosphere flows to integers - this is what `mapping` is, a dictionary from flows to integers, which is in a sense just a giant counter. Each new flow inserted into `mapping` gets the next biggest integer. `index` will be the index in the matrix, e.g. row 0 or row 42.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can now guess what `add_mappings` does - you could define normalization factors for completely new biosphere flows. `mapping` needs to know about all flows, so we add all flows in each normalization method (flows already existing are ignored by `mapping`).\n",

    "For each `dtype_field`, we need to define what kind of number to use - in this case, we choose a 32 bit unsigned (i.e. implicitly positive) integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `process_data`, we take as an input a single row from the normalization dataset, and return the values that go into the `dtype_fields` we define above, as well as the actual data value. In this case, for `flow` we in the integer number given by looking our biosphere flow up in `mapping`. For `index`, we insert a dummy value, as this will be determined dynamically as we build the matrix (we don't know how big the normalization matrix is yet).\n",
